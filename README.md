# Color-Composition-Similarity
This repository contains the dataset for Color Composition Similarity. 

Color Composition Similarity is measured by human judgement on the scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is the least similar and 5 is the most similar for a pair of images. The color similarity is evaluated independent of the content (object/image classes) as much as possible.

**The similarity in color composition of an evaluated image to its reference image can be rated as:**

* **1. Very different:** neither the image colors, nor their layouts is similar at all.
* **2. Substantially different:** less than 50% of the colors are similar, and their layouts are a bit similar.
* **3. Fairly similar:** about 50% of the colors are similar and their layouts are similar.
* **4. Substantially similar:** more than 50% of the colors are similar and their layouts are similar.
* **5. Very similar:** image colors and their layouts are mostly the same.
